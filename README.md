## Results

A mongoDB dump of our results is available in the [results folder](results/), these results are based on the [capture.pcap](results/capture.pcap) file which is the file generated by [pyshark](https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark) of all the packets we received during one day from a smartphone device.

Charts based on these results:
